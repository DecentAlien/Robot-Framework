AT.MD.012.001
	[Documentation]			UCC's rules of counting for both Logical SLOC counting and Differencing should stay consistent. In other words, Baseline A's total logical SLOC = deleted + modified + unmodified, and Baseline B's total logical SLOC = new + modified + unmodified.

AT.MD.013.001
	[Documentation]			UCC should consider files in Baseline A that do not match to files in Baseline B as "deleted".

AT.MD.017.001
	[Documentation]			UCC should consider a logical line of code in Baseline B, if different by more than the threshold percentage from the line it is being differenced with in Baseline A, "new", and the line being compared to should be considered "deleted".
